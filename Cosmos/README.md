### Instruction Prompt
A sophisticated robotic assembly line features two robotics arms working in tandem. The left arm, sleek and black, is equpped with a precision griper, delicately handiling a rectangular package labelled 'Kawada'. The right arm, robutst and white is similarly outfitted, poised over another package. Both arms are mounted on a metallic base, surrounded by a grid-like conveyor system. The background reveals a clean industrial settting with a focus on automation and efficiency. Bright, even lighting highlights the mechanical details, casting subtle reflections on the metallic surfaces. The scene remains static, emphasizing the precision and coordination of the robotics arms as they perform their tasks with meticulous accuracy.
